      <h2>Jim DeMordaunt's Portfolio for WDD230</h2>
      <div class="pokemon">
      <p>IndigoTM is a team building app I am developing. Features include Pokemon lists loaded from the pokeAPI. A favorite feature allows for selection of favorites by a user.
        Future features I plan to add are a selection of teams from favorites and a sign-in service. To do the sign in feature I want to wait till I can use some backend features which are outside the scope of the class. In the long run I would like to make this into an app for iphone. The color pallet was selected to match a phone app setting. There are a lot of features I have partially setup code for which I want to work on later. The initial load of the pokemon lists is heavy, but I have setup code to cache most of the resources on the first page-load to reduce drag on data-plans. The page-weight is something I want to reduce in the longrun.
